evolutionary-circuits
=====================

Automatically generates analog circuits using evolutionary algorithms.

Requires ngspice. Also probably only works on a linux OS.

Interesting stuff happens on cgp.py. circuits.py is used to communicate with
ngspice, plot.py is not used by program but it can be used to plot outputs of
ngspice. getch.py gets a single character from output.
